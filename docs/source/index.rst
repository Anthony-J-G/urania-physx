Physics Simulations in C++
==========================

This repository contains multiple different implementations of various physics simulations. It currently uses `Raylib <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib>`_ as a backend to handle rendering,
sound, input event handling, as well as some other platform speciifc functionality so the main focus of the repository is on the physics. For more information on the ``Raylib`` API, you can reference the `API cheatsheet <https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html>`_ or the `multitude of examples <https://www.raylib.com/examples.html>`_
